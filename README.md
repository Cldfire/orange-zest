# orange-zest

A library that provides functionality to "zest" SoundCloud for your data (such as your likes, playlists, and comments).

This is WIP and intended to be used for archival purposes and/or automating the process of moving your music away from the SoundCloud platform (because it's a flaming train wreck at this point).

**Please** use it responsibly.
